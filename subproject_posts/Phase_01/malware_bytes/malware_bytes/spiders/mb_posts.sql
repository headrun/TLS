The tool was perfect - except for one thing: it was way too cheap. Therefor NSA leadership, who had fallen into the hands of industry, dumped it - three weeks prior to 9/11.

Exploits\n- Exploit code can be any kind of code that exploits a vulnerability or a functionality in an unintended fashion.Â  For example a Wimad trojan exploit Digital rights Management ( DRM\n).Â  The Lovsan/Baster worm was both a virus and used exploit.Â  It exploited a vulnerability in RPC/RPCSS and uses TCP port 445 to infect a computer and spread the infection.\n3. Viruses\n- Viruses are a kind of malicious code that is able to spread autonomously.Â  UnlikeÂ  a trojan which needs assistance to spread, a virus can infect data files, media, executable binaries and that can be used to spread the infection.Â  Such as file to file or file to computer or file to media and media to computer.Â  For example a file infecting virus may inject malicious code into an executable file.Â  It may prepend, append or cavity inject the malicious code.Â  Once that file is infected it may spread the infection to other other files and computers.Â  Two examplesÂ  are the Virut and sallity.\nAnother form of virus used the boot sector of the oldder file Allocation Table ( pre-NTFS) such as the N YB and Form viruses.Â  the infected computer would pass the infection to a floppy which could then infect another computer.\nAnother form of virus is the Macro Virus.Â  it took advantage of VB macros in MS Office.Â  If a infected document is opened then MS Office would be infected which would, in turn, infect non-infected documents.Â  Those infected documents could infect other systems.Â  this type of virus was one of the first to cross the OS barrier as long as MS Office was installed on that OS.Â  Personally, I prefer calling them a parasite due to the fact it only \"lives\" in the MS Office environment.\nThere are also sub-type of viruses such as worms.Â Â  That has sub-types such as internet worms, and AutoRun Worms.Â Â Â  Internet Worms use TCP/IP protocols such as the Lovsan/Blaster using TCP port 445.Â  Or it can use email ( SMTP ), NetBIOS over IP, SMB, NNTP, etc.Â  AutoRun worms use the AutoRun and AutoPlay OS facility in removable media to spread from PC to media and from media.\nSome may combine aspects like the Lovsan/Blaster using both exploit code and being an Internet worm.\nToday the vast majority of malware are trojans.Â  Due to newer constructs in Win32 and Win64 and NTFS, many viruses have died off.Â  You won\'t see viruses like the Melissa virus anymore.\n**\nNote that I have provided a Reader\'s Digest\nversion of information in monologue and I have simplified the explanations.\nEdited 10 hours ago\nby David H.

A VPN has nothing to do with when/how/where a breach of a server, company, operation, or entity is breached.\nQuote Â \nOn 12/29/2018 at 4:53 PM, David H. Lipman\nsaid: Which brings up another point.Â  Trust in the VPN provider.Â  When you use a VPN connection you shift that trust from your ISP to the VPN provider.Â  Can you trust them MORE\nthan you trust your ISP ?\nÂ \nIn the US, yes for some VPN providers. For the most part authorities have access or easy access to logs from an ISP in the US without much push back. At least for some VPN in other Countries that are not part of the 5, 9, 14 eye Countries\nit makes it more difficult to obtain data, assuming they have data to give.\nThis episode for PureVPN really hurt their trust in the community.\nPureVPN Logs Helped FBI Net Alleged Cyberstalker\nhttps://torrentfreak.com/purevpn-logs-helped-fbi-net-alleged-cyberstalker-171009/\nhttps://www.goldenfrog.com/blog/purevpn-no-log-claims-false\nÂ \nA VPN prevents direct decryption of your connection, meaning that someone snooping the network would not be able to decode what it is your doing. However, the server you\'re connected to can certainly log everything you\'re doing and with enough resources you can be tracked and found. If you\'re doing something illegal a VPN will not protect you.\nFor more privacy than VPN you wouldÂ  want to look at using TOR\n- though, once again there are mistakes made that can lead to your identity being found.\nVPN will keep your employer from knowing what your doing, but depending on how sophisticated the company is they will know you\'re reaching out to an unauthorized node and block it.\nVPN will keep your ISP from knowing what you\'re doing\nOne has to realize why you\'re wanting or using a VPN and decide for yourself it you need it or want it.\nI really like CyberGhost VPN - it works very well and even works with bypassing Netflix to use from another Country. What I don\'t like is the fact that a marketing company bought them.\nCyberGhost was previously owned by Robert Knapp\nâ a German tech entrepreneur â and based/operated out of Romania. However, that has all changed since Knapp sold CyberGhost VPN to Israeli investors. In 2017 Knapp sold CyberGhost to an Israeli company called Crossrider\n- no signs of that marketing being pushed down into the program yet, but still difficult to trust it will remain that way.\nExpressVPN is well rated on many sites and does work well, but it\'s claims of working with Netflix did not work for me. I spent 2 different days and a couple of hours working with their Technical Support and was not able to get it working with Netflix. Cyberghost on the other hand has been used many times and have never had it fail to work with Netflix, though they do say that success is not always guaranteed.\nÂ \nÂ \nEdited December 30, 2018\nby AdvancedSetup\nupdated information\n','\"[\'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=system&controller=content&do=find&content_class=forums_Topic&content_id=241008&content_commentid=1289575\', \'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=members&controller=profile&id=14644\', \'https://torrentfreak.com/purevpn-logs-helped-fbi-net-alleged-cyberstalker-171009/\', \'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement\', \'https://www.goldenfrog.com/blog/purevpn-no-log-claims-false\', \'https://www.torproject.org/\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241008-is-it-worth-to-get-a-vpn-in-2019/','2019-02-07 10:03:48','2019-02-07 10:03:48'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Is it worth to get a VPN in 2019?','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241008-is-it-worth-to-get-a-vpn-in-2019','',_binary '1289961','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241008-is-it-worth-to-get-a-vpn-in-2019/?do=findComment&comment=1289961',1546245600000,1549533828098,'digmorcrusher','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/147313-digmorcrusher/','\nAssume everyone will eventually get breached, your bank, IRS,Â  ebay,Twitter etc. If you want to protect yourself lmit the amount of data you put online, other than that just assume that your data will be out there one day.

several more proactive protection components like Web Protection to block malware sites and malvertisements (a common infection vector) as well as Exploit Protection which is by far the most frequently used means of infecting users through malicious exploits.Â  Because of this, the most likely threat you\'re going to encounter would be the occasional PUP installer and that\'s about it, and that\'s only if you download a PUP installer (like if you\'re the type of person who frequently downloads \"free\" software on the web like screensavers etc.), but otherwise you shouldn\'t encounter much in the way of real malware if Malwarebytes is doing its job.\nYou can also extend this protection by installing the Malwarebytes browser extension which is currently in beta and available for free for both Chrome (and any other Chromium based browser like SRWare Iron) and Firefox.Â  You can check out the links below to find out

the browser extension is an amazing leap forward and isn\'t promoted nearly enough in my opinion (though it\'s understandable I guess since it\'s still in beta, though its effectiveness cannot be overstated).Â  I\'ve seen just how effective it is against new/unknown malicious sites of certain categories and it has such a high rate of detection/blocking that it really is a game changer in my opinion and I can\'t wait for it to be released, hopefully integrated into Malwarebytes 3 to further enhance the protection it offers (though I wouldn\'t be opposed to them continuing to offer it for

that\'s why I have a custom shield configured for sidebar.exe in the Exploit Protection component of Malwarebytes; no malicious gadget or hijack of the site(s) any of my gadgets might communicate with will be capable of compromising my system) as well as Windows Dreamscene, the animated desktop wallpaper functionality exclusively available to Windows Vista Ultimate users as one of their \"Ultimate Extras\" which could be re-enabled in any version of Windows 7 through the use of a free tool found on the web.\nWhen Windows 8 came out I was absolutely disgusted with what I saw.Â  Microsoft, in their infinite wisdom, decided that a single interface should be used for all devices, including smart phones, tablets and other touchscreen devices so they forced this horrible, flat, ugly, unwieldy user interface on everyone, even on desktop platforms and non-touch devices called \"Metro\" via their new \"Start Screen\".Â  This same web-like aesthetic persists today, though to a much smaller degree, in both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 with an app store, live tiles and a flat, ugly UI that looks like it was made using construction paper.Â  XP with its default Fisher-Price looking \'Luna\' theme was bad enough (though it could be changed easily enough, both with legit alternatives from MS, including their awesome looking \"Zune\" theme with its glossy black and orange color scheme as well as their gorgeous modern interpretation of Luna designed for Windows Media Center Edition 2005 called \"Royale\" which they made available to everyone via their website), but the flat, lifeless UI in 8/8.1 and Windows 10 is just terrible in my opinion and I can\'t understand why, when computing hardware is more powerful, energy efficient and advanced than ever before, they would decide to force this drab, minimalist looking UI on everyone when both Vista and 7 showed us what modern hardware could do and what an elegant OS shell could look like thanks to Windows Aero and its glass transparency effects.Â  They even eliminated Flip 3D, one of the most useful task-switching utilities/functions ever created in my opinion (especially once I map my middle mouse button to the WIN Key+START command to initiate it with a single click, enabling me to use my mousewheel to quickly scroll through all open windows and programs to navigate between them with ease, all the while providing me a live 3 dimensional preview of each window\'s/program\'s contents making massive multi-tasking and task-switching a breeze; the old Alt+Tab command pales in comparison in my opinion).\nI hate to see 7 go, but time and technology stop for no one, and Microsoft knows this better than most, so it\'s a sad fact that I must accept, though I won\'t let go without a fight.Â  I fully intend to continue using Windows 7 even after its official End of Life date.Â  I may end up using whatever clever tricks they come up with to extend its ability to receive updates such as tricking Windows Update into believing it is the \'Embedded\' version of the OS which Microsoft plans to support for at least a full year or more beyond the EoL date for the desktop versions of Windows 7, but more likely I\'ll just continue to do what I\'ve always done: keep my security apps and tools active and up-to-date, keep my system locked down with all non-essential components disabled or removed from the OS to reduce the attack surface, and of course practice safe hex when surfing online.Â  I may even go as far as running a browser within a VM just for that extra layer of defense against infection, though I doubt it will be necessary.Â  I\'ll also continue using my massive HOSTS file which blocks countless malicious websites, ads and tracking servers (something I couldn\'t do on Windows 10, since Microsoft eliminated this functionality for the HOSTS file; likely to prevent users from blocking their telemetry servers, though that\'s justÂ myÂ opinion)Â which currently contains almost 870,000 entries, including blocks for common social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and more (because I don\'t use them and would rather not have their embedded trackers monitoring my every move throughout the net) and I\'ll keep using alternatives to Google such as DuckDuckGo and SRWare Iron to guard my privacy from their massive telemetry machines and I\'ll keep blocking their trackers and ads along with everyone else\'s.\nÂ \nÂ \nEdited January 26\nby exile360\n','\"[\'https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/end-of-windows-7-support\', \'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4487594/prepare-now-for-end-of-support-in-2019-and-2020\', \'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057281/windows-7-support-will-end-on-january-14-2020\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241763-the-end-is-near-the-age-of-7-coming-to-a-close/','2019-02-07 10:03:53','2019-02-07 10:03:53'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','The End is Near! - The Age of 7 Coming to a Close','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241763-the-end-is-near-the-age-of-7-coming-to-a-close','',_binary '1294045','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241763-the-end-is-near-the-age-of-7-coming-to-a-close/?do=findComment&comment=1294045',1548146400000,1549533833255,'David H.

some genius at Microsoft (likely at the prompting of someone from a third party hardware manufacturer who figured out this is how it should be a long time ago :P\n) finally figured out that it might be a good idea to stop preventing basic, core, identical hardware drivers from installing on different devices just because some higher level software components and/or additional drivers/files may be specific to certain device types and OEMs (such as the driver software for notebooks which tend to focus on power saving features and avoiding thermal issues).Â  For a long time, many hardware manufacturers (looking at you, AMD) would prevent their standard/generic drivers from installing on some platforms/devices, especially notebooks and tablets because they assumed that the OEM that built and sold the system would provide their own \'special\' driver for the hardware.Â  This is because, especially in laptops, tablets, all-in-ones and other non-desktop form factors, manufacturers will sometimes tweak the drivers they provide to customers to provide better battery life as well as down-clocking to prevent overheating.Â  The trouble is, all too often OEMs don\'t often update their drivers, and when they do, it is often much less frequently than the original hardware component manufacturer meaning that, unless the end user is allowed to install the more up to date drivers from the component manufacturer (such as Intel, AMD or NVIDIA), they are likely to miss out on major feature updates and bugfixes, including BSOD fixes, performance enhancements, security/vulnerability patches and other important updates to the core driver components.\nIt sounds reasonable in theory since it often is the case that an OEM will provide special drivers for the components shipped in their systems to customers to improve battery life and to optimize for the smaller, and often lower powered form factor for their non-desktop devices, however if you, like me, have ever actually taken a look at the base driver files being installed (not so much the \"control\" software or registry settings etc. that control things like power output, device sleep settings, low power modes, thermal throttling and device clock speeds/boost speeds etc.), they are completely identical so there is absolutely no reason that a person shouldn\'t be able to update these files using the drivers from the original component manufacturer\'s website using their much more up to date driver installation package.\nSo now, with DCH, hardware creators will have the opportunity to provide base/core driver packages that just update the core driver components without altering any of the higher level settings that control things like low power modes, sleep modes, thermal throttling settings and clock speeds/boost speeds so that users can have the best of both worlds.Â  All the benefits of the specially tuned/customized higher level settings/software provided by the system builder (the OEM) as well as the bugfixes, performance improvements and security/vulnerability patches provided by the individual component manufacturer who will often roll out driver updates much more frequently.\nI\'m amazed that nobody thought to do this sooner, but at least it\'s here now, and hopefully hardware developers will adopt this standard quickly now that Microsoft has implemented it and is pushing for it.\nYou can find out more about this feature on Microsoft\'s website here:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/getting-started-with-universal-drivers\nYou can read Intel\'s announcement (where I originally found out about this new feature/initiative) here:\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000031572/programs/intel-corporation.html\nTo tell you the truth, I\'ve always installed the drivers from the individual component manufacturers rather than my system\'s OEM because of this issue since the OEM\'s drivers would invariably be out of date almost immediately and you were lucky if you got two updates for a component\'s driver throughout the entire lifetime of the device when new drivers would be released multiple times a year if not monthly from the individual components\' manufacturers and because, even though I do use a laptop, I do not run it off the battery (unless the power goes out; I like the laptop form factor for use around the house but don\'t actually take my system anywhere outside my home so it\'s always plugged in just like a desktop and I\'ve optimized the cooling solution by replacing the thermal paste and modding the internals of the laptop to improve the airflow and eliminate any issues related to heat, thus allowing me to run a stable overclock on my hardware components full-time without any thermal throttling issues whatsoever).\nThis is one of the longest standing issues to create frustration and confusion for computer users and is one of the primary reasons so many users try these \"driver updater\" programs (which are generally PUPs and not recommended\n) and also why these types of programs will so often fail to detect/download/install the correct device drivers for a user\'s particular hardware components/system, because there are so many different versions available from so many sources.Â  DHC should eliminate the need for these types of applications, enabling users to go to a single known good source for each individual component to update their core driver components (especially since the higher level/performance/tuning related stuff isn\'t likely to change much if at all in most cases).\n','\"[\'https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2015/06/driver-updaters-digital-snake-oil-part-2/\', \'https://content.invisioncic.com/Mmalware/emoticons/default_tongue.png\',

couldn\'t think of any other good way of talking about this without flooding the forum in a bunch of different topics, so I decided the best option was to put this here.\nDue to how many questions actually turned up in the end, I have decided to organize them so they\'re easier to answer. Feel free to use said organization. (Ex: A1 or A-1)\nSo obviously I\'ve been on the forums a lot\nlately, and the reason why is that I\'ve kind of been having an episode when it comes to the security of me and the family. They think I\'m crazy for wanting to be so safe, but knowing what\'s been going on these past few years I don\'t really want to take any chances. It\'s been really hard for me to figure out what\'s safe and what\'s not when it comes to security and safety. I know there\'s plenty of sites involving these questions, but most of them tend to trigger Web Protection, stray off topic, or describe them in weird ways that may be unsafe. I\'d really like answers to as many of these as possible, as it\'ll help me calm down more. Though I can understand if answering too many can be excessive. Hopefully all of these are really good questions to be asking, and maybe I ask some that have never really been thought about before.\n[A] Involving Windows and PCs:\nShould I be disabling things that I don\'t need / wish I didn\'t have that could be invading privacy, such as the Windows Store and Cortana?\nShould I have a Microsoft Account enabled and synced on Windows?\nIs it a bad idea to have the sync on when it comes to said account?\nBesides antivirus, disk cleanup, uninstalling unused software, etc., what\'s the best way to keep the PC clean and protected?\nIs it bad to have old data on the PC from things like old games and software? What\'s the best way to remove it?\nWhich is the safest solution to keeping a computer secure locally: PIN, Password, or Picture Password?\nWhen it comes to PCs in general, is it safer to build it or to buy it pre-built to avoid bloatware, built-in adware, etc.?\nIs Bluetooth safe to use on PC?\nUsing Bluetooth with headphones / headset, is it possible for trojans / spyware to intercept what I\'m listening to / who I\'m talking to?\nInvolving Mobile Devices:\nDue to mobile devices being less restrictive when it comes to on-the-go apps, data, etc., what\'s the best way to keep the device secure from malware, spyware, etc. besides Malwarebytes?\nI do not feel comfortable with the mobile device\'s camera. Should I cover it?\nA device is a few years old it feels like it\'s slowing down and it\'s missing things like SMS and calls over a certain time, also certain notifications. Should I be worried that there\'s a security flaw?\nWhat\'s a good way of cleaning a mobile device that doesn\'t involve a factory set, as to not lose all the data?\nA family member has a lot of apps downloaded on their device, and seems to have an excessive amount of tabs open on said device. Though, when I scan it with Malwarebytes (Free) and Sophos, nothing shows up. Is there still a chance that malware and such is heavily embedded into the device?\nIs there a way to block ads in-app like you can in a browser with something like uBlock?\nKnowing it being a recent issue, Is there a good way of preventing interceptions with things like SMS and calls?\nBesides Location (only turn on when I need to), what other settings should I keep off to keep me incognito from other apps and services?\nIs it better to buy mobile devices from stores or from the official site?\nI\'m hearing notifications go off even though there isn\'t any when I open the screen. It is a known issue on some devices, however I\'ve never had something like this happen with mine. Am I just going crazy?\nEither from store providers or mobile companies, how do you fully remove bloatware from your phone?\nWhat\'s the safest solution to keeping a mobile device secure on the lock screen: Knock Code, Pattern, Pin, Password, Fingerprint Scanner, or Picture Password?\n[C] Involving Consoles, Smart Devices, Cable Boxes, etc.:\nThe Xbox One is a Windows-built console, and the PS4 tends to be very social. Obviously there\'s a possibility they can get malware and such, but whats a good way to remove said malware if the device is infected? Malwarebytes for Xbox One / PS4 when?\nXbox in general is a well known domain when it comes to hacking and hijacking, especially when it comes to Xbox (Microsoft) accounts. What\'s a good way to keep away from most hacks and hijacks, and what\'s the best way to keep a Microsoft account secure from hijacks on Xbox?\nAds are extremely excessive and invasive when it comes to the Xbox One. Is there any way to block them without doing anything shady?\nIs Bluetooth safe to use in public areas?\nUsing Bluetooth with headphones / headset, is it possible for malicious passerby\'s to intercept what I\'m listening to / who I\'m talking to?\nDue to recent events, how can you secure Smart TV\'s, Home Devices (Fire Stick, Chromecast, etc.), Printers, etc. from exploits via ports / connections?\nIs it better to keep Smart TVs disconnected at all times?\nWhat\'s the safest solution when it comes to using apps and services on other devices: Consoles, Home Devices, or Smart TVs?\nIs there any way to block the sometimes excessive ads on Smart TVs and Hubs?\nSome people are prone to leaving these devices on overnight or for extended periods of time, myself included. Is this a bad thing to do security-wise?\n[D] Involving Accounts and Account Protection:\nWhat\'s the safest solution when it comes to remembering passwords: Writing them down, a password manager, or a password encryption service (Where they make new passwords constantly, and supposedly only you have access)?\nCertain sites like to opt in to use apps or services without consent and cause security risks, even if they are legitimate. How to I opt out / remove said apps or services?\n[E] Involving 2FA:\nWhat\'s the safest solution when it comes to an authenticator: Microsoft, Google, or Authy?\nAlthough I have an authenticator on, there\'s still an option for me to use SMS to login. Since SMS can be intercepted, can this be a security issue?\nIs it safer to have an authenticator on PC or a mobile device?\n[F] Involving Web Browsing:\nI want to stay anonymous on the web for the most part. Is there extensions to do so besides uBlock?\nI wish to avoid accidental typos in the search engine, but it doesn\'t seem to automatically do it anymore. What should I do to avoid this?\nIs it possible for a browser stealer to steal cookies and use them for malicious intent (account hijacking, spoofing, etc.)?\nHow do I know which news is legitimate and which ones are exaggerated / hidden ads?\n[G] Involving Email:\nIs it safer to use email on a browser or in an app?\nIs it still possible to get viruses and malware just by opening an email?\nCan opening emails on a mobile device in-app give me a virus or malware?\nHow do I keep excessive spam from being sent to an email?\nIs it better to have a clean inbox, or have dated mail in case of certain situations?\n[H] Involving IP, DNS, Router security and safety, etc.:\nAlthough I have all settings on, I only see specifics in the log that may be hiding reasons why things are acting suspicious. What can I do or use to see the full traffic on the router?\nWhat is the difference between a Proxy and a VPN? Please be descriptive.\nIs it a good idea to have a Proxy / VPN on 24/7?\nIs it a good idea to have a Proxy / VPN on the router?\nWhat\'s the ideal way of keeping out exploits and such as to not have hijacks happen besides updating firmware, disabling UPnP, Remote Access, and updating the password?\nI am seeing strange sites being allowed to certain devices in the logs that doesn\'t match up to the usual or secured traffic. Does this mean the router could be infected, or just a specific device(s)?\nThe router may be infected and I wish to factory reset, but the only computer is clear across the house and moving it could risk damage. What do I do?\nI wish to have an Ethernet connection but I am across the house and I am unable to do any modifications to said house. What is the best option?\nIs an Ethernet connection always safer than a WiFi connection?\nIs it possible to have 2 separate connections (Not the same network, SSID, etc.) on 2 different routers and modems on the same line?\nIs it possible for one router to get infected from another router, even though they\'re on 2 different modems?\nWhich is safer: Cable internet or Satellite internet?\nIs it safer to use the ISP provided DNS, or an open DNS?\nInvolving Financial Security and Safety:\nIs it a bad idea to have sites remember payment information, even if it involves subscriptions?\nWhat\'s the best way to avoid skimmers and possible walk-by\'s with readers?\n[J] Involving Data and Backup:\nWhat is the best device to use when it comes to external backup of data?\nIs OneDrive a good idea when it comes to storing personal data such as images and documents?\nIs there any way to backup data on mobile devices that doesn\'t involve syncing?\nIs it a bad idea to have Google backup a mobile device\'s data, such as settings, sensitive data, etc?\nIs there a way to encrypt data fully when it comes to backups to where only I can decrypt it?\n[K] Involving General:\nIs it bad to be so worried about security all the time, even if I want to keep everyone safe?\nIs it bad to be so paranoid, even when nothing is wrong security-wise?\nIs it bad to check things like Security News and such daily if it only fuels my dilemma?\nInvolving the above questions. If so, should I think about taking classes for things like this, that way I feel safer knowing what\'s wrong and being able to help?\nIt\'s obvious that the family doesn\'t seem to care much about safety and security, and may be a reason why I\'m asking all these questions in the first place. Should I have a meeting with them to talk about things like this so they fully understand, and so they stop pulling my hair out?\n[L] Just Some Ideas Y/N:\nBuildable phones. It\'d be way cheaper, and you\'d know what you\'d have in your phone already. Y/N?\nMultiple-Factor Authentication (MFA), specifically 3 or more, being more common. That way if they manage to get through one authentication via brute force, they still need to get through more. Not only this, but if an authenticator was first and they manage to brute force it, but they can\'t get past the second one in a specific amount of time, it\'d require them to reenter a new authentication again which they obviously don\'t have. It could also work great with passkeys and fingerprint scans. Granted, it\'d take more time out of your day.Â  Y/N?\nAutomatically changing recovery codes. Some sites automatically disable attempts after a certain amount of tries, but there\'s still that what-if chance of brute force. Not quite sure how you could send them to the account holder though without potentially being exposed, however... Y/N?\n2FA / MFA for payment sources online. Kind of hard to explain, but imagine if every purchase from an unknown IP or location was forced to use a specific authentication before you could purchase something, and not just your average 2FA from the site itself. I feel like it\'d help out a lot when it comes to possible leaks and such, as along with this it could notify you when your card or account was used in an unknown location or IP before\nany damage happens. That way, you can have your card our account info changed or frozen if needed. I was also going to talk about doing this physically, but it seems like banks are slowly starting to roll out the feature on ATMs (finally). Y/N\nAgain, sorry for having so many questions. It\'s just that I want to be safe and secure in the end.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241243-just-a-lot-of-questions/','2019-02-07 10:04:17','2019-02-07 10:04:17'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Just a Lot of Questions','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241243-just-a-lot-of-questions','',_binary '1291162','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241243-just-a-lot-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1291162',1546836900000,1549533857013,'ElectroTheDevolian','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/237017-electrothedevolian/','\nWell, the listing was supposed\nto work.

Lipman says above, I have to agree.Â  This is why I\'m still running Windows 7 on my own system and plan to never \'upgrade\' to Windows 10 and plan to put 7 on any new system I might acquire in the future.Â  I also don\'t use a smart phone.Â  I have an old flip phone that I use to make calls and the occasional text and it never goes online/on the web.Â  I don\'t use social media unless you count these forums and the occasional comment on YouTube (no Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) and I do a lot of things to protect my privacy including blocking advertising, tracking and social networking sites from connecting to my system/browsers via my HOSTS file along with Malwarebytes, the Malwarebytes browser extension beta, Adblock Plus andÂ Ghostery.Â  I also disable, modify and outright break/cripple system components and capabilities that I do not use, including the webcam in my laptop (which is painted over at this point so that it is physically disabled along with being disabled in the Device Manager), any extra network protocols besides IPV4 for connecting to the internet on my network connections (no file/printer sharing, no remote access etc.; all that stuff is turned off and/or disabled), and since I don\'t use them, things like tablet PC services, remote desktop/remote management and other \'features\' in Windows that I don\'t use are all turned off/disabled or removed (where possible).\nMy approach is a bit excessive and it\'s not just for the sake of privacy, it\'s also for performance (fewer services/processes running in the background/running at system startup etc.).Â  Unfortunately Microsoft has figured out that users like myself do these things, and since they want to keep that telemetry data flowing (since, as David mentioned, you are the commodity; why else would Microsoft have offered Windows 10 for free to everyone who had 7/8/8.1?; they\'ve always charged hundreds of dollars for their operating systems, but suddenly their latest and greatest and supposedly \"last version of Windows ever\" is free?Â  I don\'t think so...it costs something, and it\'s very expensive, it\'s just not measured in dollar amounts), they\'ve made using the HOSTS file, as well as keeping many of these unnecessary items disabled impossible, either through changes in the OS or, as David mentioned, through updates that reset things back to their defaults.Â  They also wish to follow current trends, which is why their operating systems now cater more to mobile devices/tablets and smart phones than traditional laptops and desktop PCs because they see the success of Apple/the iPhone and Google/Android devices and want a piece of that pie.Â  Thankfully, due in large part to the fact that the current generation of gaming consoles has gotten quite long in the tooth with no new hardware expected until at least 2020, more gamers are returning to/getting into PC gaming, so the desktop PC enthusiast scene is helping to keep traditional PCs alive, which is one of the key reasons Microsoft hasn\'t been able to kill off traditional desktop/laptop PCs in the past few years even though everyone, including them, was predicting that the smart phone and tablet would have replaced them almost completely by now (with the exception of some business use cases, of course).\nEdited January 8\nby exile360\n','\"[\'https://blog.malwarebytes.com/\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241243-just-a-lot-of-questions/','2019-02-07 10:04:17','2019-02-07 10:04:17'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','What\'s the Best Way to Find Your Old Accounts?','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241224-whats-the-best-way-to-find-your-old-accounts','',_binary '1291086','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241224-whats-the-best-way-to-find-your-old-accounts/?do=findComment&comment=1291086',1546841220000,1549533858994,'ElectroTheDevolian','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/237017-electrothedevolian/','\nSo recently I got a spam email saying the whole \"Here\'s [insert old password here] I was not payed to do so I know who you are blah blah\" and it did spook me for a second, but after I realized I changed all my major accounts\' passwords a few days ago in a recent panic attack along with all the others that have been changed prior, I laughed it off and deleted it.\nStrangely enough it showed up in my spam not too long after I checked the Wallpaper forum (first and last page only, apparently it\'s unsecure.) and Haveibeenpwned to see if my email was pwned.

I always have my inbox clean, so I have no real way I\'ve searching way back in the past to find them besides painfully going through all the sites I remember using, and there still may be some out there.\nI feel like the best way to fix this old account solution would be to be able to ping all accounts via sending you an email from your email(s), but I guess that\'d be going heavily against privacy, and if you ever were to get hacked / breached they could use that against you and obtain everything a lot faster...it truly is a questionable predicament.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241224-whats-the-best-way-to-find-your-old-accounts/','2019-02-07 10:04:18','2019-02-07 10:04:18'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','What\'s the Best Way to Find Your Old Accounts?','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241224-whats-the-best-way-to-find-your-old-accounts','',_binary '1291090','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241224-whats-the-best-way-to-find-your-old-accounts/?do=findComment&comment=1291090',1546842600000,1549533858996,'exile360','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/2103-exile360/','\nGreetings\nI don\'t know of any reliable way to retrieve old accounts, however as long as you aren\'t using that old password any longer on any current sites, and assuming none of the old sites you may have used were keeping any current/relevant financial or personal data then you should be relatively safe (short of the occasional spam scam attempt, obviously).Â  You could try doing a web search for your commonly used user names and email address(es) to see if they are linked/mentioned on any sites, though that will likely only show social sites like forums and the like where that info gets posted publicly, but other than that I really don\'t know how you would or could go about discovering which sites you\'ve used in the past if you can\'t recall using them.Â  I suppose it would be best to focus on financial/retail sites and the like where more sensitive info is more likely to be stored, and perhaps trying to login there and perhaps even contacting their support personnel to check and see if they have any of your data (which they should be able to validate by sending something to your email so that they know it is actually you and not an imposter of course), but I suppose if only trying to change one old password, then all you\'d have to do is try logging in to know whether you used such sites or not so I don\'t know how helpful that would be.\nEither way it\'s always best to never use the same password twice, and even to change user names frequently across sites so that your info cannot be so easily linked and used by someone malicious in the future for any nefarious purpose.Â  Using a password manager may also help as I know many people use those these days to keep track of their user names and passwords, allowing the use of many different and more complex passwords that you would normally not be able to remember thus making it more difficult for anyone to brute force or guess them to access your accounts online.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241224-whats-the-best-way-to-find-your-old-accounts/','2019-02-07 10:04:18','2019-02-07 10:04:18'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Ever wanted to play with a Quantum Computer?','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241024-ever-wanted-to-play-with-a-quantum-computer','',_binary '1289666','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/241024-ever-wanted-to-play-with-a-quantum-computer/?do=findComment&comment=1289666',1546145160000,1549533861033,'Amaroq_Starwind','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/256387-amaroq_starwind/','\nTurns out D-Wave systems actually developed an API so that you can utilize their quantum computing resources through a remote connection.

Which is stupid, because if they decide to deprecate it, then nobody is going to want\nto use it... And yet the need for the features in Transactional NTFS is actually quite prevalent in a number of real-world scenarios, and I feel like the only way to get Microsoft to not deprecate it is for people to actually start using it. IfÂ more people were to actually try to use Transactional NTFS, then others might want to follow the example, and more, and more. I do not wish to see Transactional Filesystems go the way of WinFS (I still mourn for you, Windows Future Storage), and I will be deeply saddened if it does.\nNot only could Microsoft\'s own products probably try to make better use of TxF, but I feel like maybe Anti-Malware solutions could make better use of it too. For example, if Malwarebytes were to implement Transactional NTFS support, it could probably be helpful for remediation purposes, not to mention they could mention in a blogpost (or even in advertisements) that MB3 would officially support Transactional Filesystems, and other Anti-Malware vendors might even take notice.\nDoes anyone here want to help spread the word regarding Transactional NTFS, try to work support for it into your programs, and/or discuss ways existing software could be updated to utilize it (for example, in what ways might AV software make use of it)?\nAnd because it\'s directly related, what are your thoughts about WinFS? Would an open-source, cross-platform spiritual successor be viable, and how would you try to make use of it?

and welcome :)\nIt really depends on the source.Â  If they are trusted and known throughout the community for the app in question then probably so and you should research what others have to say about the mod (forums etc., assuming they are discussed there), but otherwise it\'s a real gamble, especially if you\'re just looking for cracked/licensed versions of paid apps (a very common way for the bad guys to trick users into infecting themselves with Trojans and the like).\nHonestly, the only 100% safe thing to do would be to only use un-modded apps from official sources, or if there are official modded versions (as is the case with some games, for example, especially when they have been released as open source), to download those.\nThe type of app you\'re trying to download can also play a big part in it, as some apps are more likely to be targets of malicious actors than others.Â  For example, cracked paid software like I mentioned before is a common target, as are many games, especially those launched through Steam as there are many threats that seek to harvest Steam login credentials and game assets that have value (such as in-game items which they can sell for real money).\nAt the very least, be sure to scan any apps you download with a good anti-malware solution like Malwarebytes and checking it with a multi-engine service such as VirusTotal would be a good idea as well, and if the download is only available from a Bittorrent site, warez/crack site or file sharing service like Megaupload etc. then it also has a higher chance of possibly being malicious (though obviously not guaranteed; just more likely than if it were hosted on a dedicated site or legitimate software forum related to the official version of the application in question).\nIf what you seek is a portable version of a piece of software that normally requires installation, and assuming the original software developer hasn\'t made one available, then I\'d only trust it if hosted on a reputable site like PortableApps.com or MajorGeeks.com etc. where they are known to test and validate the files and software they host.\nEdited December 12, 2018\nby

the way, if you\'re talking about mobile apps for smart phones etc., then many of the same guidelines still apply, and it would also be a very good idea to research why the app isn\'t hosted on the official store for your device/OS (like the Google Web Store, MS App Store, Apple\'s iOS app store etc.) because they will often reject or remove apps that violate their policies, such as embedding advertisements (adware) or collecting customer data (spyware) so if you can find any discussions about the app from unbiased users who have tried it or are familiar with it (not just people encouraging others to download it blindly) that would also be a good place to start.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/240405-is-downloading-modded-apps-safe/','2019-02-07

is used occasionally, but I think for the most part it\'s because of the long history of backwards compatibility between x64 and x86, and most installers and the like were originally written for native 32 bit environments so there isn\'t much need for QWORD and other native x64 data types.Â  MS pretty much dictates what is commonly used for things, and even if you look at the hardware drivers\' services keys in the registry, they\'re all using DWORD value types, even on native 64 bit Windows versions so my guess is it\'s either because of compatibility requirements, for ease of use/translation between x86 and x64, or simply because there\'s no real benefit from using QWORD and other native x64 data types (and most likely some combination of those reasons).\nYou can chat up the folks on MS Technet about it if you want something more concrete from industry insiders, but I\'m betting it\'s probably just a matter of utility and there probably just isn\'t much need for it/reason to do it that way.Â  It\'s the same reason that even though most systems are now running 64 bit operating systems, many software programs are still coded in native x86/32 bit because they just wouldn\'t benefit from the larger addressable number of bits/amount of memory that native x64 provides.Â  It makes sense if you think about it.Â  I mean if you have an application that you know has no business ever consuming anywhere near the 4GB limit of a 32 bit application, why would you sweat rewriting it into native x64?Â  I mean what\'s the point?Â  Some may argue that a native x64 application is faster since it bypasses the x86 emulation layer, but I\'ve run both native x64 and x86 versions of multiple applications in the past on my systems to test these very things and I can tell you that I couldn\'t tell the difference, even between native Windows applications like Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player which are both tied in so deeply to the OS core that you would think they of all programs would show some benefit from the added \"speed\" of using native x64 code, but I honestly couldn\'t tell any difference.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/240327-miscellaneous-windows-registry-talk/','2019-02-07 10:05:04','2019-02-07 10:05:04'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General

you couldn\'t do that sort of thing with Intel integrated graphics on lower end machines because they don\'t have that computing capability) so whether you\'re using the CPU or GPU to do it, it\'s going to raise the power output of the system (not to mention heat, which can also be risky) which in turn shortens the battery life of the device.\n2.\nHistory has proven that any feature introduced as an option disabled by default will not be used/enabled by the vast majority of users so its benefit would be extremely limited.Â  Most people ignore such alerts/notifications (and many are hostile towards them because they just want their security apps to shut up and quietly do their jobs and only inform them if there is a problem/infection etc.), and so it likely wouldn\'t be worth pouring the Dev resources necessary into it to make it happen unless it were enabled for everyone out of the box.Â  This is especially true because it is a preventative/protection mechanism.Â  It\'s not like rootkit scanning which you only really need as a last resort when you think you\'re infected to check for/remove an installed/active rootkit; this is a protection mechanism designed to prevent threats from making malicious modifications to the registry, so it really needs to be turned on otherwise what\'s the point?\nWhile it is true that whitelisting safe/known good processes can help, there\'s also the issue that the bad guys could easily exploit some vulnerability or use legitimate methods to write malicious data into the registry, so whitelisting virtually anything could pose a serious risk to the system\'s security because you can bet the bad guys would test to determine if any processes are allowed/whitelisted then figure out how to take advantage of that fact.\nThe reality is it\'s just too easy to change things via the registry, but on the flip side it\'s just as easy to change them back, so a remediation only approach like Malwarebytes uses currently is really sufficient, especially since the more proactive protection mechanisms are far more likely to identify and stop the attack/threat before it ever gets that far.\nThat also doesn\'t address the fact that many legit sysadmins in the business world regularly use such restrictive registry policies (including many that Malwarebytes would normally detect as PUM) to help secure the systems they manage, and it\'s much less of a headache if they only have to worry about a scan setting off a detection for a policy they\'ve put in place than it would be to deal with an active protection mechanism preemptively stopping their policies from taking effect (the number of support tickets generated on the business side would skyrocket in no time, guaranteed).\nI don\'t want to slam the idea or anything (again, I myself proposed this very thing years ago to the Devs when I was in Product Management for Malwarebytes so I do see the value), but I really think there\'s a good reason most vendors choose not to do this these days (there used to be many more tools/products that did, but they weren\'t widely used and were often seen as more of a hassle to work with than they were worth, just like most HIPS and third party firewalls that behave like/include HIPS type components/functions).Â  In fact, I believe this is the very reason Safer Networking stopped including TeaTimer with Spybot S&D and why, even in the later 1.x releases, it wasn\'t installed by default any more (you had to check a box in the installer to install it) and it would be in a read-only/allow-all type mode relying on a blacklist of known bad processes and registry changes even if you did install and enable it, making its function far more limited/less proactive (unless you changed it to paranoid mode to make it act like the old versions did; so again, more steps/non-default settings).\nIt\'s a lot like User Account Control in Windows.Â  It was a great idea and it works well to help secure a system against attackers and malware, however Microsoft turned it down in Windows 7 and later versions deliberately because the prompts came up too often and users got annoyed, either turning it off or becoming trained to always click Yes\n, OK\n, or Allow\nso it wasn\'t serving its purpose any more.Â  They found a good balance I think, but even today we still come across users who have UAC completely or partially disabled on their systems even though it poses a risk to their security just because they don\'t want to deal with the prompts/notifications at all.Â  Introducing any such mechanisms into Malwarebytes would likely get so many complaints that they would end up pulling the feature back anyway, or as you say having it off by default, which means hardly anyone would use it, especially the novice/normal users who in fact are the ones who really need the extra security the most (the more technical users like you and me can always check our registries and loading points with tools like Autoruns and will recognize when something is there that doesn\'t belong, so we don\'t really need the babysitter watching over us to tell us when it happens, though it might be a bit more convenient).\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/240327-miscellaneous-windows-registry-talk/','2019-02-07 10:05:04','2019-02-07 10:05:04'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Miscellaneous Windows Registry Talk','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/240327-miscellaneous-windows-registry-talk','',_binary '1286478','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/240327-miscellaneous-windows-registry-talk/?do=findComment&comment=1286478',1544528760000,1549533904689,'Amaroq_Starwind','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/256387-amaroq_starwind/','\nWell, it could also just scan the registry at regular intervalsÂ to Â silently recordÂ any and all changesÂ that occurred since the last periodicÂ registryÂ scan, and using existing APIs to determine what processes were running at that time to try to deduce which processes were responsible for which changes (again, recording only, no immediate actions).

We could potentially end up with another Microsoft, which wouldn\'t exactly be a good thing. Even if they don\'t become corrupt (which I highly doubt they would, they\'re Malwarebytes!), it is still very possible that they\'d become too large to effectively manage, and nobody wants a company that\'s too big to manage.\nAnd of course, would it even beÂ a wise investment? What if it\'s a decision that only leads to the company going bankrupt?

more) to provide protection against both known and unknown threats as well as common attack vectors (exploits, malicious scripts etc.).\nUnfortunately, if even Google, who no doubt has more access to newly created web content/files than most other organizations can\'t accurately classify all items as malicious or safe, what hope does any security company with limited resources have?Â  Don\'t get me wrong, the filtering in Chrome (as well as in IE/MS Edge) is great, and has been tested and proven to do quite well against a slew of known bad sites/files, but it still falls short of the mark with regards to correctly identifying all threats and unsafe sites which is why users running that browser, even when using a solid AV on top of it, still get infected sometimes.\nIt\'s sad, but for all our efforts to protect the users, the bad guys are always working just as hard with the same or greater resources at their disposal to get around those security measures and infect as many users and make as much money as they can.Â  It is quite literally an endless digital arms race.\n','\"[\'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=members&controller=profile&id=256387\',

What I don\'t like is that Cyberghost sold out to Crossrider aka Kape who sells and develops 2 products that have dismal reviews. I\'m not saying that Cyberghost is like that but when the parent company owns them who knows how long before they cross the line and the product deteriorates. They already stopped their Free VPN service which they\'ve had for a long time. It ends this month, and now you have to have a paid version to use it.\nThe below information is what I\'ve found via Google search - make up your own mind about Cyberghost. Currently I still us it since I\'ve paid for it and I don\'t see any obvious signs of ads or issues using it at this time aside from their own ads trying to get you to buy it. Why they provide an ad to buy when you\'re logged in with a paid version I\'m not sure but at least it\'s just their own product and not ads for other stuff.\nÂ \nIsraeli company Crossrider buys Romaniaâs CyberGhost for EUR 9.2 mln\nhttp://business-review.eu/news/israeli-company-crossrider-buys-romanias-cyberghost-for-eur-9-2-mln-132813\nPUP.Optional.Crossrider\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-crossrider/\nNew Crossrider variant installs configuration profiles on Macs\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/04/new-crossrider-variant-installs-configuration-profiles-on-macs/\nCrossRider at McAfee\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-intelligence.malwaretc.html?vid=6946096\nÂ \nTeddy Sagi\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Sagi\nIn late 2012 Sagi acquired the start-up company Crossrider for $US 37M\nCrossrider renamed Kape after switching to cybersecurity\nhttps://en.globes.co.il/en/article-crossrider-renamed-kape-after-switching-to-cybersecurity-1001227178\n\"We have completely broken away from the ad-tech world and over the past year we have proven our major capabilities in cybersecurity that was demonstrated by the solid growth in top line and profitability\"\nÂ \nCyberGhost joins the Crossrider group\nhttps://blog.cyberghostvpn.com/en/cyberghost-joins-the-crossrider-group/\nCrossrider re-branded to Kape technologies plc\nhttps://www.crossrider.com/\nKape - Our Products\nhttp://www.kape.com/\nDriverAgent\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/7ab785/driveragent_isnt_safe_to_use/\nhttps://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?t=1382379\nhttps://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/phoenix-technologies/beaverton-oregon-97006-north-andover-ma-01845-milpitas-california-95035/phoenix-technologies-driveragentcom-only-2-of-11-drivers-recomended-were-usable-all-ot-384389\nReImage\nhttps://www.stopscamware.com/registry-scam-reimage-repair\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_other-protect_scanning/reimage-scam/19d2442b-b189-4d38-a469-2589d7c9b09e\nhttps://davescomputertips.com/is-reimage-repair-legitimate/\nReimage Reviews and Complaints\nhttps://reimage.pissedconsumer.com/review.html\nÂ \nÂ \n','\"[\'http://business-review.eu/news/israeli-company-crossrider-buys-romanias-cyberghost-for-eur-9-2-mln-132813\', \'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Sagi\', \'https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2018/04/new-crossrider-variant-installs-configuration-profiles-on-macs/\', \'https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-crossrider/\', \'https://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?t=1382379\', \'https://blog.cyberghostvpn.com/en/cyberghost-joins-the-crossrider-group/\', \'http://www.kape.com/\', \'https://reimage.pissedconsumer.com/review.html\', \'https://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/phoenix-technologies/beaverton-oregon-97006-north-andover-ma-01845-milpitas-california-95035/phoenix-technologies-driveragentcom-only-2-of-11-drivers-recomended-were-usable-all-ot-384389\', \'https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/7ab785/driveragent_isnt_safe_to_use/\', \'https://davescomputertips.com/is-reimage-repair-legitimate/\', \'https://thebestvpn.com/reviews/purevpn/\', \'https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn/\', \'https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-crossrider-renamed-kape-after-switching-to-cybersecurity-1001227178\', \'https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2427041,00.asp\', \'https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_other-protect_scanning/reimage-scam/19d2442b-b189-4d38-a469-2589d7c9b09e\', \'https://www.stopscamware.com/registry-scam-reimage-repair\', \'https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-intelligence.malwaretc.html?vid=6946096\', \'https://www.crossrider.com/\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239573-does-vpn-enhance-the-online-security/','2019-02-07 10:06:00','2019-02-07 10:06:00'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','The reality of persistant rootkit/bootkit infection.','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239117-the-reality-of-persistant-rootkitbootkit-infection','',_binary '1280322','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239117-the-reality-of-persistant-rootkitbootkit-infection/?do=findComment&comment=1280322',1541831520000,1549533963307,'Fast_Eddie','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/256259-fast_eddie/','\nI was reading a thread here about some guys suffering from a rather persistant malware infection, only to have the thread closed on them by the root admin of this site with a statement about it being hysteria or snake oil or whatever...\nÂ I certainly respect the opinion of someone with unquestionable experience like running malwarebytes...

Think of what any of the many state sponsered outfits have come up with or are capable of.\nDid i mention this was in 2012?\nPlus there have been things like subvirt and othet vmbr rootkit/bootkits that can turn the host os into a virtual machine... easily remote backdooring at will, flashing a router would allow something like that to spread like the black plague hitting phones, tvs and any other smart devices that it can connect to.

I\'m not so sure that any of it is recoverable one an attack starts reflashing device firmware.\nIts been a truley disheartening experience to say theÂ least and the full reality of the who, what, where and whyÂ is probably much worse then the average enthisiast has even considered.\nI mean absolutely no disrespect and i am not fear mongering, i sincerely hope you can use some anti hacker kung fu to help me recover some hardware... and maybe restore my faith in IT Security.\nAnyone wanting to read that pdf about Rakshasa will have to google Rakshasa rootkit.Â Â Its like the first or second link..

Unbelievable. They off all people definitely should know better. Frankly, if anyone should\nbe completely paranoid it is them\n, as it is pretty much their core business to defendÂ against these and other malicious practices that most people would call \"hysteria\". Sadly, it is anything but hysteria.\nThe unfortunate reality is that security software like Malwarebytes will always be several steps behind reality. That\'s simply the nature of it. The possibilities to infiltrate systems are close to endless, all you need is a bit of creativity. Something nobody else has thought about yet (bonus points if you think of something that others would refer to as \"hysteria\"). Your defensive strategy has to get it right 100% of the time while an attacker only needs to get \"lucky\" once.Â I tend to call IT security purely symbolic for this reason*. There is simply no feasible way to be sure you haven\'t been silently pwnedÂ already by some obscure attack vector (BIOS/firmware injection as you have outlined definitely being one of them), not for the average consumer at least. Well, unless you have the equipment and time to indepedently read the contents of flash memory/storage devices and the ability to analyze the tiniest ofÂ microchips.\n* Not claiming IT security is not important, it very much is.\n','\"[\'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=system&controller=content&do=find&content_class=forums_Topic&content_id=239117&content_commentid=1280322\', \'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=members&controller=profile&id=256259\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239117-the-reality-of-persistant-rootkitbootkit-infection/','2019-02-07 10:06:03','2019-02-07 10:06:03'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','The reality of persistant rootkit/bootkit infection.','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239117-the-reality-of-persistant-rootkitbootkit-infection','',_binary '1280375','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239117-the-reality-of-persistant-rootkitbootkit-infection/?do=findComment&comment=1280375',1541832240000,1549533963312,'Aura','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/178814-aura/','\nCan you link the thread you\'re talking about?\nQuote Â \nQuote\nÂ These things are not really new either...Â  Johnathan Brossard demo\'d Rakshasa at Blackhat, Defcon, CCC, BHCI and i am guessing everywhere else touting it as the\nÂ \n:Â \nMost of these were POCs to prove that it is possible to create something like that, but not a lot, if not any of them made them in the wild and were used.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239117-the-reality-of-persistant-rootkitbootkit-infection/','2019-02-07 10:06:03','2019-02-07 10:06:03'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','The reality of persistant rootkit/bootkit infection.','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239117-the-reality-of-persistant-rootkitbootkit-infection','',_binary '1280417','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239117-the-reality-of-persistant-rootkitbootkit-infection/?do=findComment&comment=1280417',1541903340000,1549533963314,'AdvancedSetup','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/2065-advancedsetup/','\nIt\'s called paranoia.

Â \nOn 11/10/2018 at 6:44 PM, Aura\nsaid: Can you link the thread you\'re talking about?\nMost of these were POCs to prove that it is possible to create something like that, but not a lot, if not any of them made them in the wild and were used.\nYep, the difficulty lies mostly in the fact that each of these BIOS infectors must be coded to attack a particular BIOS version/manufacturer, and with so many in use today across different boards and systems, creating a threat capable of infecting a large number of targets in any generic fashion the way more traditional attacks and exploits do wouldn\'t be feasible.Â  That\'s the reason we haven\'t seen any of these in the wild yet.Â  Also, recent evolutions in the realm of OS boot loaders like EFI/UEFI have further complicated things making it much more difficult to get underneath the hardware than it used to be, especially for more modern operating systems like Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10.\nToday, especially with the massive increase of mobile/smartphone use on the web, attackers are far more focused on exploiting browsers and browser plugins which are much easier to develop as cross-platform threats (i.e. capable of infecting Windows PCs as well as mobile devices running Android and iOS etc.).\nAre such infections possible?Â  Absolutely, however the access required and coding needed for targeting your specific hardware elevates the cost and specialization to a level that, unless you are a particularly high value target, no one is going to go through all the hoops and difficulties to develop those threats to attack you with.Â  It\'s much more realistic in the business/enterprise and government space where they face more targeted attacks like APTs, but even then, there are much stealthier methods which require less privileged access to infiltrate and infect systems without having to get write access to the hardware\'s firmware to infect devices, so even across that landscape these types of attacks are not very likely.Â  Do keep in mind that we\'re not talking about some kind of simple computer worm, file infector or generic exploit here where rapid propagation is a high probability.Â  These kinds of attacks are extremely specialized and require very low-level/privileged access to a system and its components to pull off, and if an attacker has that level of access already there are a wide array of other, much easier and more conventional infection vectors for them to exploit that would be far more cost effective both in regards to the time and effort to develop the attack, and the financial cost of R&D to develop a successful attack.\nWith all that said, I\'ve always seen the greatest risk factor with these types of threats to be on the manufacturing side of things.Â  If someone were to infiltrate a factory where a particular piece of hardware is produced, they could distribute infected firmware to the devices being made there to have their malware distributed to whoever the hardware was intended for.Â  This is also why governments tend to be mindful of their hardware vendors and equipment providers as they must have reliable chain of trust in place to prevent such attacks.\n','\"[\'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=members&controller=profile&id=178814\',

But bitdefender itself is quite heavy.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239577-av-with-malwarebytes/','2019-02-07 10:06:13','2019-02-07 10:06:13'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','AV with Malwarebytes','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239577-av-with-malwarebytes','',_binary '1282349','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239577-av-with-malwarebytes/?do=findComment&comment=1282349',1542768600000,1549533973479,'jadinolf','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/4900-jadinolf/','\nOn all 5 machines- ESET NOD32 on 2 and ESET Internet Security on 3.\nI\'m one of those old geezers who hasÂ  lifetime licenses of Malewarebytes on all of my computers.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/239577-av-with-malwarebytes/','2019-02-07 10:06:13','2019-02-07 10:06:13'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Researcher finds simple way of backdooring','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/238186-researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring','',_binary '1276339','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/238186-researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring/?do=findComment&comment=1276339',1539840360000,1549533975537,'pondus','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/19914-pondus/','\nResearcher finds simple way of backdooring Windows PCs and nobody notices for ten months\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring-windows-pcs-and-nobody-notices-for-ten-months/\nhttps://csl.com.co/rid-hijacking/\n','\"[\'https://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring-windows-pcs-and-nobody-notices-for-ten-months/\', \'https://csl.com.co/rid-hijacking/\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/238186-researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring/','2019-02-07 10:06:15','2019-02-07 10:06:15'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Researcher finds simple way of backdooring','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/238186-researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring','',_binary '1276343','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/238186-researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring/?do=findComment&comment=1276343',1539844140000,1549533975539,'exile360','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/2103-exile360/','\nYikes, that isn\'t good.Â  Glad I have the guest account disabled as well as all remote login/remote desktop capabilities (though that may not entirely matter if I\'m reading the article correctly).Â  Hopefully Microsoft will patch this vulnerability soon because it appears to be very low-hanging fruit for the bad guys.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/238186-researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring/','2019-02-07 10:06:15','2019-02-07 10:06:15'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Researcher finds simple way of backdooring','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/238186-researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring','',_binary '1276436','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/238186-researcher-finds-simple-way-of-backdooring/?do=findComment&comment=1276436',1539928920000,1549533975541,'mountaintree16','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/13640-mountaintree16/','\nYikes.

But as you said, a checksum value can be used to represent a particalar file, so how can we detect which malware that infect into file? For example: If we have a infected file, how can we detect that it was infected and which malware infected through checksum?

I haveÂ my friend who is a software developer and computer hacker fix my computer in less than 20 minutes. He agree with me, that I got hijack by an outsource employee of malware.

Basically some malicious site will show up in an ad or a search result, and fool people into calling an illegitimate \"tech support company\" to resolve the non-existent issues with their computer. I\'m sure you are all very familiar with the concept. In delivering my presentation, I would like to be able to show my audience live examples, both to show them what scam sites look like, and also to demonstrate methods of exiting the scam sites. (Since you can\'t close the tab normally because they inject malicious javascript).\nHowever, I can\'t use real scam sites because they tend to get taken down once they are discovered. I am also not interested in trying to browse the dark web to find such sites or their malicious code.\nSo, I\'m hoping to find live example pages I can visit, which I canÂ use in my presentation,Â hosted by a legitimate security research company. I\'d even settle for the raw html and javascript and just set up a server on my local machine for the demonstration. I just want a real example so my audience can get a feel for what it\'s like to get these popups, with they way it freezes up the browser, the way it won\'t let you leave the page, the scary voiceover, etc... I also want to also show them how they can get rid of the popup on a live example.\nDoes anyone know where I could get something like this?\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/236180-looking-for-live-demo-sites-of-tech-support-scams/','2019-02-07 10:06:42','2019-02-07 10:06:42'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Looking for live demo sites of Tech Support Scams','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/236180-looking-for-live-demo-sites-of-tech-support-scams','',_binary '1267460','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/236180-looking-for-live-demo-sites-of-tech-support-scams/?do=findComment&comment=1267460',1536034140000,1549534002362,'gonzo','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/141357-gonzo/','\nHere is an excellent starting point:\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/tech-support-scams/\nÂ \n','\"[\'https://blog.malwarebytes.com/tech-support-scams/\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/236180-looking-for-live-demo-sites-of-tech-support-scams/','2019-02-07 10:06:42','2019-02-07 10:06:42'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Looking for live demo sites of Tech Support Scams','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/236180-looking-for-live-demo-sites-of-tech-support-scams','',_binary '1267461','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/236180-looking-for-live-demo-sites-of-tech-support-scams/?do=findComment&comment=1267461',1536036600000,1549534002364,'dmjohnson23','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/223069-dmjohnson23/','\nQuote Â \nOn 9/4/2018 at 4:09 AM, gonzo\nsaid: Here is an excellent starting point:\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/tech-support-scams/\nÂ \nThat looks like a great resource I can use in my research, thanks for the link.

A security bug allowed third-party developers to access Google+ user profile data since 2015 until Google discovered and patched it in March, but decided not to inform the world. When a user gave permission to an app to access their public profile data, the bug also let those developers pull their and their friendsâ non-public profile fields. Indeed, 496,951 usersâÂ full names, email addresses, birth dates, gender, profile photos, places lived, occupation and relationship status were potentially exposed, though Google says it has no evidence the data was misused by the 438 apps that could have had access.\nThe company decided against informing the public because it would lead to âus coming into the spotlight alongside or even instead of Facebook despite having stayed under the radar throughout the Cambridge Analytica scandal,â according to an internal memo. Now Google+, which was already a ghost town largely abandoned or never inhabited by users, has become a massive liability for the company.\nREAD FULL STORY AT SOURCE: https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/google-plus-hack/\n','\"[\'https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/google-plus-hack/\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237679-google-to-shut-down-after-coverup-of-data-exposing-bug/','2019-02-07 10:06:49','2019-02-07 10:06:49'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Google+ to shut down after coverup of data-exposing bug','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237679-google-to-shut-down-after-coverup-of-data-exposing-bug','',_binary '1274248','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237679-google-to-shut-down-after-coverup-of-data-exposing-bug/?do=findComment&comment=1274248',1538991480000,1549534009357,'David H.

so it probably isn\'t infected, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean that there isn\'t something else going on.Â  A system\'s files or Windows installation can be corrupt out of the box brand new.Â  It isn\'t terribly common, however it is possible and I\'ve seen it first-hand on multiple occasions both as a PC technician and with systems of my own.Â  Driver issues can crop up at any time, including when the Windows install is new (in fact, this can make them even more likely since often times the drivers that ship with the system are older/not the latest and therefore are more likely to contain bugs which may have since been fixed in later driver releases).\nI am not saying that it is absolutely impossible that all of the issues you\'re having are caused by apps installed, however I just don\'t think it is very likely.Â  You can try removing them though, and if it helps that\'s great, but if it doesn\'t fix the issues then you might consider investigating the other potential causes I

most likely correct about the time and dataset size issue, but I suspect that much of it is in preparation for the eventuality of mainstream quantum computing and some degree of true artificial intelligence (not just the basic machine learning/heuristics algorithms that exist currently that so many industries falsely claim as \"AI\").Â  Currently their main weapon of choice is keyword flagging, which has an extreme probability of FPs, especially with so many aware of these mass surveillance programs (meaning there is a very high probability of people deliberately saying \"bad\" words such systems would likely flag and making dissenting/threatening sounding statements in jest just to create such possible FP events and to waste the bureaucrats\' time, money, manpower and resources).Â  The reality is, anyone actually speaking of such things would not use any obvious terminology and would likely speak in code that deliberately sounds like common, normal conversation using some obscure keying system based on either a privately created code or some obscure text all participating parties are privy to.Â  There are far too many simple ways to fool machines (and people) for a mass surveillance program to be capable of catching anyone beyond the less sophisticated/minor threats that no one in their right mind would justify expending such resources and technologies to catch (i.e. common, local crime, small time drug deals, pranks etc. etc.) and I sincerely doubt those monitoring would find it worth it to expose their surveillance capabilities by seeking to apprehend any offenders of that nature so it\'s essentially a self-defeating system, no matter how \"quiet\" they try to be about it at this point.\nBasically the cat is out of the bag at this point, everybody knows about it, both friend and foe, so the awareness of the system of mass surveillance defeats the entire purpose and justification for the existence of the system of mass surveillance.Â  There\'s an old saying, \"Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.\" and in this case, far too many people know far too much for their \"secret\" systems of surveillance to be a legitimate threat to anyone they seek to thwart or capture using it.Â  They were beaten as soon as word got out about the Homeland Security Act and the Patriot Act and as soon as all the cameras started going up everywhere in the UK.Â  At that point I think only the most ignorant were unaware that we now live in a surveillance state, and that definitely includes the bad guys who have an incentive to conceal their actions and plans from the organizations who have access to such tools.Â  To put it into IT security terms, it\'s like the bad guys taking all of their latest malicious creations and uploading them to VirusTotal to be scanned to see which vendors, if any, detect them.Â  As soon as any file is shared there all of the participating vendors have access to it for analysis so the bad guys have already lost.Â  This is why they\'ve set up their own offline scanning systems that don\'t provide the samples to the vendors whose engines they scan them with so that they can still test their new wares for efficacy in their stealth capabilities to evade detection without giving malware researchers direct access to their new binaries before they\'ve even sent them out to the wild to infect unsuspecting users and potential targets.Â Â \n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/236714-security-flaw-in-%E2%80%98nearly-all%E2%80%99-modern-pcs/','2019-02-07

The WEA portion of the test commences at 2:18 p.m. EDT, and the EAS portion follows at 2:20 p.m. EDT. The test will assess the operational readiness of the infrastructure for distribution of a national message and determine whether improvements are needed.\nThe WEA test message will be sent to cell phones that are connected to wireless providers participating in WEA. This is the fourth EAS nationwide test and the first national WEA test. Previous EAS national tests were conducted in November 2011, September 2016,Â  and September 2017 in collaboration with the FCC, broadcasters, and emergency management officials in recognition of FEMAâs National Preparedness Month.\nCell towers will broadcast the WEA test for approximately 30 minutes beginning at 2:18 p.m. EDT. During this time, WEA compatible cell phones that are switched on, within range of an active cell tower, and whose wireless provider participates in WEA should be capable of receiving the test message.\nSome cell phones will not receive the test message, and cell phones should only receive the message once. The WEA test message will have a header that reads \"Presidential Alert\" and text that says:\nâTHIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.â\nThe WEA system is used to warn the public about dangerous weather, missing children, and other critical situations through alerts on cell phones. The national test will use the same special tone and vibration as with all WEA messages (i.e. Tornado Warning, AMBER Alert). Users cannot opt out of receiving the WEA test\n.\"\nÂ \n','\"[\'https://www.fema.gov/emergency-alert-test\', \'http://www.fema.gov/frequently-asked-questions-wireless-emergency-alerts/\', \'https://www.fema.gov/emergency-alert-system\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system/','2019-02-07 10:07:00','2019-02-07 10:07:00'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','USA:  FEMA - Nat\'l Test of the Wireless Emergency Alert system','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system','',_binary '1272932','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system/?do=findComment&comment=1272932',1538454180000,1549534020321,'Firefox','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/17127-firefox/','\nThanks for the heads up.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system/','2019-02-07 10:07:00','2019-02-07 10:07:00'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','USA:  FEMA - Nat\'l Test of the Wireless Emergency Alert system','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system','',_binary '1273234','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system/?do=findComment&comment=1273234',1538565360000,1549534020323,'exile360','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/2103-exile360/','\nYeah, I freaked out today when my phone suddenly made that annoying sound and immediately killed it after seeing what it was then took to the net to find out what was going on.\nA useful tool in a real emergency I suppose.Â  I just hope they don\'t start doing regular tests of it as frequently as they used to on my former cable provider (I cut the cord years ago, so no idea how it is now) which used to be at least 2-3 times a week (even though they always claimed it was only weekly).\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system/','2019-02-07 10:07:00','2019-02-07 10:07:00'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','USA:  FEMA - Nat\'l Test of the Wireless Emergency Alert system','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system','',_binary '1273240','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system/?do=findComment&comment=1273240',1538566920000,1549534020326,'gonzo','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/141357-gonzo/','\nSamuel\nÂ \nIf you had Comcast, its because they do counties and county groups.Â  Right hand was completely unaware of what left hand was doing.Â  Nowadays both hands are reaching into your pockets.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system/','2019-02-07 10:07:00','2019-02-07 10:07:00'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','USA:  FEMA - Nat\'l Test of the Wireless Emergency Alert system','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system','',_binary '1273245','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237393-usa-fema-natl-test-of-the-wireless-emergency-alert-system/?do=findComment&comment=1273245',1538657580000,1549534020328,'exile360','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/2103-exile360/','\nHehe, not my pockets, at least not any more ;)\nÂ \nI only use AT&T DSL now and have no complaints (except that it isn\'t fiber, but at least I get around 7 megabits instead of the 6 I actually pay for/which is the highest they offer;

Based in Portland, Ore., Elemental made software for compressing massive video files and formatting them for different devices. Its technology had helped stream the Olympic Games online, communicate with the International Space Station, and funnel drone footage to the Central Intelligence Agency. Elementalâs national security contracts werenât the main reason for the proposed acquisition, but they fit nicely with Amazonâs government businesses, such as the highly secure cloud that Amazon Web Services (AWS) was building for the CIA.\nTo help with due diligence, AWS, which was overseeing the prospective acquisition, hired a third-party company to scrutinize Elementalâs security, according to one person familiar with the process. The first pass uncovered troubling issues, prompting AWS to take a closer look at Elementalâs main product: the expensive servers that customers installed in their networks to handle the video compression. These servers were assembled for Elemental by Super Micro Computer Inc.\n, a San Jose-based company (commonly known as Supermicro) thatâs also one of the worldâs biggest suppliers of server motherboards, the fiberglass-mounted clusters of chips and capacitors that act as the neurons of data centers large and small. In late spring of 2015, Elementalâs staff boxed up several servers and sent them to Ontario, Canada, for the third-party security company to test, the person says.\nNested on the serversâ motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasnât part of the boardsâ original design...\"\nÂ \n','\"[\'https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZN:US\', \'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies\', \'https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SMCI:US\', \'https://www.elemental.com/\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237484-the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-us-companies/','2019-02-07 10:07:02','2019-02-07 10:07:02'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. Companies','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237484-the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-us-companies','',_binary '1273442','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237484-the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-us-companies/?do=findComment&comment=1273442',1538646480000,1549534022055,'Firefox','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/17127-firefox/','\nApple & Amazon refute Bloomberg report of tiny Chinese spy chips in their servers\nhttps://thenextweb.com/apple/2018/10/04/apple-amazon-chinese-spy-chips/\n','\"[\'https://thenextweb.com/apple/2018/10/04/apple-amazon-chinese-spy-chips/\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237484-the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-us-companies/','2019-02-07 10:07:02','2019-02-07 10:07:02'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Computer Tools','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237431-computer-tools','',_binary '1273132','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/237431-computer-tools/?do=findComment&comment=1273132',1538539680000,1549534024007,'obsidian2','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/254966-obsidian2/','\nI have a question for bothÂ the forum members &Â  the Malwarebytes team\nDoes MalwarebytesÂ have a product that the general public can purchase, itsÂ a tune up your computer program tool, which goes through all the files on your computer and rectifies any faults with things like theÂ registry, and other computer relatedÂ issues that need to be resolved, like reinstalling missing files say for the CD player, or other similar issues ?

However, in general, the majority of these tools are close to being snake-oil. ( a product, policy, etc. of little real worth or value that is promoted as the solution to a problem )\nIf you have a problem with a computer you should fix that problem and not just throw a hundred fixes at the computer that may or may not have even been valid years ago. Often these tools make changes that were only valid for Windows many years ago, some they make were never good fixes.\nIf you\'re missing core operating system files then you should run a System File Checker scan to fix it.\nSFCÂ  /SCANNOW\nWindows 7 and 10 already run many automated routines to keep their health in good shape. If something comes along and breaks the computer then seeking out a forum like here or similar and having someone knowledgable assist you in fixing that issue would be a much better choice. Just make sure the person helping you does have experience.\nIf you\'re currently having issues please let us know and I\'m sure we can assist you in fixing it or at least discussing what\'s going on

agree wholeheartedly, however I\'d also add that even these so-called \"professional\" tests are often flawed by today\'s threat landscape\'s standards on the basis that the vast majority ignore essential steps in the attack chain of real-world threats and infection attack events, especially when it comes to trapping live exploits, which 9 times out of 10 are where virtually all web based attacks/malware infections now begin.Â  Even if they do try to replicate aspects of the initial attack phase, the methodology is often flawed because they simply download and execute malicious scripts direct from the malicious hosts rather than being served them through malvertisements embedded in otherwise legitimate websites, through compromised legit sites, or through deliberately compromised malicious sites.Â  Very seldom do any of these tests begin at the same phase as the real attacks where users have become infected.Â  This is why I really don\'t trust any of them to provide a comprehensive view of the efficacy of any modern security products because most security products, AVs included, are now layered offerings which include many components to the protection they provide, often with many of the most powerful and effective aspects of protection being bypassed by the poor methods they choose for testing (just like the \"YouTube\" testers they say so much about in their article).\nA true professional test setup must either a\nstart the attack chain from the real beginning through the identification and use of a truly compromised legit site (which unfortunately often rotate ads/malicious content with legit content so replicating it reliably to test each product is virtually impossible and often play host to polymorphic threats that change too rapidly for the test to be the same and fair to all the products being tested), or b\nto at least set up a testing server to serve the exploit as a virtualized attack which replicates the same circumstances as the real deal where the threat is found in the wild (less realistic but it at least replicates the basic steps and circumstances of the actual attack chain).Â  The latter is likely what they will start doing soon as they come to realize that this is how most threats/attacks work these days, and I can see signs of it in their evolving testing methodologies, but they\'re not quite there yet.Â  They will basically have to record the attack event then replicate the exploit/script execution/downloader etc. steps of the attack, and possibly modify and/or spoof IPs/URLs to make it look the same as the real thing in order for the test to be truly realistic.Â  It is not easy, but it is possible, however it\'s likely far more work for each infection/test than any such organization would be willing to put in which is why things are the way they are now.\nEdited August 30, 2018\nby

They use a mannequin instead of a human being , which doesn\'t press the brake before the crash (like in real life) and doesn\'t try to steer clear before the crash (like in real life) and doesn\'t oppose any force in arms (like a real person)\nYet , these tests are standard in industry and the rating is accepted by everybodyÂ Â even though THEY ARE NOT BEING PERFORMED IN REAL LIFE SITUATIONS.\nÂ \nYour whole argument is only to justify why MBAM refuses to participate in ANY\ntests ; among MBAM shieldsÂ  the Web protection is the weakest one with extremely high rate of FP ( it seems like the developers just wait for people reaction to \"remove the block in next update\")\nSo, without the Web shield , MBAM could perfectly fit in AV Test / AV comparative methodology , but when it did it the result was disastrous.Â So, it seems more profitable to keep alive a myth rather than prove something.\nIn over 5 years of running MBAM pro and MSE, Malwarebytes never detected anything , on 3 computers, so\nI do not believe\n.Â \n','\"[\'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=system&controller=content&do=find&content_class=forums_Topic&content_id=235961&content_commentid=1266495\', \'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=members&controller=profile&id=2103\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/235961-why-do-av-products-score-so-highly-in-professional-tests/','2019-02-07 10:07:19','2019-02-07 10:07:19'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Why do AV products score so highly in professional tests?','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/235961-why-do-av-products-score-so-highly-in-professional-tests','',_binary '1266589','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/235961-why-do-av-products-score-so-highly-in-professional-tests/?do=findComment&comment=1266589',1535627580000,1549534039400,'exile360','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/2103-exile360/','\nActually, my points had nothing to do with Malwarebytes\' participation in standardized testing.Â  I\'ve said before, and I still believe that they should participate, regardless of the legitimacy of the testing methods because many users do give some weight to those tests.\nMy point was entirely about the fact that many essential modules and components in most products (not just Malwarebytes) aren\'t being tested at all because of the testing methods being used.Â  Your analogy about the automotive industry doesn\'t apply because those things have nothing to do with what I\'m talking about.Â  A better analogy, if you want to go there, would be to remove the bumpers from the car and the airbags and the seatbelts and only test the frame to see how a car will do in a crash because that\'s the equivalent of these testing methods.Â  They are literally skipping entire phases of the attack chain and thus failing to test several components of protection, not just in Malwarebytes, but in most security products including most of the AVs they test.\n','\"[]\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/235961-why-do-av-products-score-so-highly-in-professional-tests/','2019-02-07 10:07:19','2019-02-07 10:07:19'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','Good glue to use to bond Epson Prem Photo Paper Glossy','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/151456-good-glue-to-use-to-bond-epson-prem-photo-paper-glossy','',_binary '846408','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/151456-good-glue-to-use-to-bond-epson-prem-photo-paper-glossy/?do=findComment&comment=846408',1403747040000,1549534041946,'David H.

Commercials and I just do not get along.\nI just started watching Andromeda on Amazon a couple weeks ago after not having seen it since way back when it was still on syndicated TV.Â  Like you, I cut the cord a few years ago and haven\'t looked back.Â  It wasn\'t just the constant commercial breaks that bothered me, it was the constant pop-ups/ads DURING shows FOR OTHER FRICKIN\' SHOWS that really bugged me.Â  It\'s like \"hey, you\'re watching this show on this channel right now, but this other show that\'s on later is WAY more important so you NEED to see this super distracting ad featuring the main character walking across the bottom of your screen\" and then when you watch the show later that they were advertising previously, they do the same damn thing, this time advertising the show you were just watching before that an ad for the current show interrupted.Â  It\'s nauseating.Â  They are so desperate to convince you not to change channels that they\'ll do just about anything to constantly force their schedule down your throat, even though everyone on Earth who can actually view most of these channels now has a built in digital guide provided by their cable/satellite company that tells them what is on when on each and every channel, so what\'s the point?Â  Just to be obnoxious and give you a reason (other than skipping the 15 commercial breaks of course) to buy the series on DVD/Blu-Ray when it comes out.\nYeah, I can do without that garbage.Â  If I want to see a show badly enough, I\'ll buy it on Amazon Video (assuming Netflix doesn\'t have it already and it\'s not included with Prime) and it\'s in lovely HD with no ads, no TV station watermarks in the corner of the screen, and no obnoxious animated pop-up ads during the show itself (not even during the credits, imagine that!).\nI hope more people follow our lead, especially now that faster internet is becoming more widely available.Â  The prices for TV keep rising, yet the quality of the content keeps dropping.Â  It\'s no wonder I watch mostly shows from the 90s~early 2000s.\nI didn\'t put up with this garbage when websites tried it (thank you HOSTS file, Adblock Plus and Malwarebytes ;)\nÂ ) and I\'m not going to put up with it from these television networks either, especially since you have to pay for the privilege of receiving most of those stations which means they\'re actually being paid at least twice; once from my TV provider (yes, your TV provider actually pays for each and every station they carry, they don\'t get any of them for free, not even the really lame ones :P\nÂ ) and then again by the sponsors/advertisers.Â  That\'s double-dipping and should be illegal in my opinion.Â  If a person is forced to pay for content, they shouldn\'t be forced to sit through hours of ads as well to view it, especially not during the program itself, that\'s just too much.Â  There\'s a reason I don\'t use Hulu and never will, and that\'s it, because they show ads, even to their paying customers.Â  So I stick with the providers who got it right from the start: Amazon and Netflix.Â  I watch stuff on YouTube too, but thanks to all the ad blocking stuff I have, I don\'t have to sit through any of Google\'s ad inserts either.\n','\"[\'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=system&controller=content&do=find&content_class=forums_Topic&content_id=134498&content_commentid=1264301\', \'https://content.invisioncic.com/Mmalware/emoticons/default_wink.png\', \'https://content.invisioncic.com/Mmalware/emoticons/default_tongue.png\', \'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=members&controller=profile&id=253447\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/235463-tv-film-ads-and-costs/','2019-02-07 10:07:26','2019-02-07 10:07:26'),('forums.malwarebytes.com','keepup','General ','[\"General Chat \"]','TV, Film, Ads and Costs','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/235463-tv-film-ads-and-costs','',_binary '1264343','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/235463-tv-film-ads-and-costs/?do=findComment&comment=1264343',1534645860000,1549534046530,'kliebor','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/profile/253447-kliebor/','\nYeah, I consider all of those things technically commercials, some more annoying than others it is true, but all pretty much advertisements that interrupt the flow of my day.\nI do not mind paying for TV but as you said before, paying a premium then also watching ads is paying twice.Â \nI love my Netflix and Amazon Prime. The recent commercials on Netflix are annoying but at least they appear once, at the end and if you are binge watching just clicking OK to start the next episode instantly closes the side screen ad for whatever Netflix series.\nMy opinion on web based ad blockers is mixed, I hate to deprive a service of revenue but I am torn as many ads are malware in disguise, I find my feelings on the situation difficult to reconcile as my home network security is very important to me.\nI am looking with a great deal of trepidation at the fracturing of the streaming landscape and every studio, broadcast group, entertainment company and distributor building their own tiny pay to watch empire. it fragments the viewing landscape, makes it harder to easily cut the cord and increases the expense to end users. If it goes too far it could make cable bundles a bargain again as users interested in watching their favorite 8Â shows need a subscription to:\nABC at $8.99\nCBS at $9.99\nDisney at $19.99\nNetflix at $14.99\nTurner Network at $14.99\nBBC at $9.99\nHulu at $9.99\nYou are suddenly looking at Cable monthly at say $50-$70 and another $90 in streaming services because each distributor yanks its catalog from Netflix or Amazon as aggregaters, removing convenience and ease of use as each service has a unique user interface, no ability to search all content easily, it is just a nightmare that looks to

haven\'t seen the ads on Netflix yet, but it\'s possible they\'re being blocked by one of my tools somehow.Â  The closest I\'ve seen are the trailers that auto-play for the show/film being advertised at the top of the homepage, but thankfully once you mute it one time, it is retained on future visits so it\'s not as distracting (plus as soon as you scroll it off screen it stops playing).\nYeah, I hate that Disney, CBS and everyone else is suddenly trying to be Netflix.Â  It makes no sense since none of them (save for maybe Disney) have a sufficient catalog to maintain a large subscription base.Â  People will try it for a week or a month to watch the one or handful of shows/films they wanted to see, then drop it as soon as they run out of new content that interests them, and with seasons being cut from 26 to 13 episodes for most series now, it\'s even less likely that they\'ll be able to retain a viewerbase for any real length of time.\nThe only ones I think might have a shot are the premium channels like HBO, Showtime, Cinemax etc., although they also offer their content via a subscription option through Amazon directly (which I think is way more convenient, and the way these other content providers should go if they really must charge exclusively for their content like that, though I\'d much rather they just sell it to Netflix instead as they have been).\nGetting to select specifically what I want to watch, when I want to watch it and without any ads or interruptions is something I\'ve gotten used to and I\'m not going back no matter how attractive they try to make it seem and I\'m pretty sure I\'m not alone in feeling that way, at least based on what I\'ve been hearing online from others on the subject.Â  It\'s no different from when music companies tried doing their own thing (especially the likes of Sony) trying to have their own version of iTunes (not that I actually use iTunes since I kinda despise Apple\'s software and I\'ve never been a fan of their proprietary format or the DRM they used to force on everyone so I buy DRM-free MP3s from Amazon) but they all flopped and eventually gave in.Â  I think it will be the same with these movie studios and TV networks.Â  They\'ll see that the market just isn\'t there for their limited amount of content, proprietary, unwieldy systems and lack of consistent standards for quality, bandwidth, pricing and availability and they\'ll ramp up their support of services like Amazon Video and Netflix, taking what they can get rather than tearing down their own houses with their own hands like some of the movie and record companies did in the past (looking at you Sony, with your damn rootkit embedded in your audio CDs).\nOn the plus side, there are services like Sling TV pushing a \"pick your channel lineup\"/pay only for what you want type service and it looks like others are starting to follow their lead with Dish and Verizon joining their ranks, likely with many more to follow.Â  I think they\'re finally getting that people are no longer willing to take whatever their providers give them when they only actually watch a handful of shows/channels each week.Â  Movie studios are starting to learn the same lesson with many more people waiting to see films until they\'re available on their favorite streaming service like Amazon, Vudu and Netflix rather than shelling out all that $ for a movie ticket to sit in a loud, crowded theater with a bunch of talkative kids (damn, I sound old :P\n) ruining the experience for them and having to watch the film when and where it\'s available with no ability to pause it if you need to go to the restroom or grab a snack (and an insanely overpriced snack at that if you get one at the theater) so they\'ve started releasing movies for streaming much earlier than they used to, with many of them getting to Netflix not long after they\'re available on DVD/Blu-Ray (and often even available early if you purchase the film on Amazon or Vudu, which is nice).Â  I haven\'t been inside a theater since 2014 when the first Legendary Pictures Godzilla came out.Â  I loved it, but I only went because I was visiting my brother and he wanted to go see a movie.Â  Prior to that I hadn\'t been since Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (MAJOR disappointment) and I don\'t miss the experience at all.Â  I\'ve got a 1080p HD screen on my laptop and that\'s good enough for me.Â  I don\'t need some massive screen that I can\'t even see everything going on in the film on at any given time because it\'s so huge, I just want it to look good and sound good and this does.Â  Getting to view it in the privacy of my own home, on my own schedule and being able to pause, resume, restart and re-watchÂ it whenever I want is the final nail in the coffin for a provider-centric experience.Â  As long as the stream is fast enough/provides sufficient bandwidth for full HD and I can watch it in my web browser (without any goofy third party add-ons or superfluous hoops to jump through) I\'m happy.\n','\"[\'https://content.invisioncic.com/Mmalware/emoticons/default_tongue.png\']\"','https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/235463-tv-film-ads-and-costs/','2019-02-07 10:07:26','2019-02-07

don\'t use social media at all and about the closest thing I participate in would be these forums and the occasional comment on a YouTube video.\nResearch has been done which shows that the use of sites like Facebook and Twitter can actually be quite addictive because it triggers certain chemicals in the brain that make a person feel excited and happy, providing instant gratification to the user but also potentially leading to several issues which may be harmful such as the anxiety you describe as well as potentially serious depression when a person doesn\'t get the friends and/or responses they would like to the content they post.Â  When you factor in things like trolling and online bullying it can become even more of a risk.\nWhile I understand that the world has changed a lot since the advent of social networking, I think it\'s a good idea at least occasionally to just unplug and unwind with friends IRL (\nin real life\nfor those not familiar with the lingo :P\nÂ ) and have real face to face conversations rather than posting it in public or semi-public to await a response on a screen.\nTexting and instant messaging can have a similar effect by the way, and that\'s not the same thing as sitting down face to face with someone to converse.\nRemember, technology is a wonderful, powerful thing that can connect us to our world in new and exciting ways, but don\'t think that it can replace your inbuilt need for real human contact.Â  Humans are social creatures after all (with a few exceptions such as hermits like me who keep to ourselves more often than not ;)\n) and if you feel the need to check your phone/computer etc. constantly in order to feel happy and validated, then maybe it\'s time to take a step back, unplug and have a real face to face conversation with friends and/or family members to remind yourself what real human contact is like.Â  The online community is great, but don\'t neglect your own tribe (family) and village (community).Â  Sit with a friend or neighbor and watch a movie or have a drink and listen to music with them, or just say hi and talk about your day.\nDon\'t allow the devices you control to start to control you, and don\'t let anonymous comments and activities on the web define your self worth or who you are.\n','\"[\'https://content.invisioncic.com/Mmalware/emoticons/default_wink.png\',

it, but when it becomes more real to a person than the actual world around them, it\'s time to reassess.Â  The thing is, people deliberately post up images and content that make it seem like they live the most interesting, amazing, glamorous, adventurous, exciting life possible, but the reality is always far more mundane and it\'s just for show.Â  It\'s like bad marketing pretty much where people try to make their lives seem worth following, but in truth they have to wait in line, they have to work and pay their bills and/or go to school, take care of kids (if they have any), do laundry, get the oil in their car changed and do all the other boring, tedious, mundane things that we all have to deal with.Â  No one lives like that, not even the wealthy, but when people see that image of that dream existence it can make them think there\'s something wrong with their own lives or something missing and can make them feel inadequate.\nI\'ll tell you a secret: it\'s all total B.S., fake, an act, pretend and the truth is always way more dull and normal than what is represented in the stories we tell each other, full of embellishments of false decadence and fake adventure.Â  It\'s pure fiction.Â  Why do you think so many people spend so much time on their phones texting and taking selfies instead of actually interacting with the people who are right in front of them?Â  It\'s because the people they\'re interacting with digitally can\'t see them so there\'s that power of anonymity that allows them to become something more than they actually are.Â  They build a false persona online that represents to them their ideal self, a flawless being who never does wrong and lives the most exciting life and when they are persecuted by life they are innocent martyrs who bravely face adversity to degrees that would make a superhero proud.Â  But most of it isn\'t real, or at the very least is colored by their emotions and desires to make more of it than what it actually is.Â  I suppose it\'s human nature, but it has consequences as you yourself have observed.\nThe next time you see something like that and it gets you down just ask yourself how many times you sprinkled the fairy dust on some event in your life when recounting it to someone to make it seem more dramatic or more meaningful and remember that everyone else on there is doing the same thing, likely times ten.\n','\"[\'https://forums.malwarebytes.com/?app=core&module=system&controller=content&do=find&content_class=forums_Topic&content_id=234771&content_commentid=1264468\',
